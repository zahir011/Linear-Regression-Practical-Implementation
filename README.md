# Linear-Regression-Practical-Implementation
Linear Regression Practical Implementation
This repository contains a practical implementation of Linear Regression using the California Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the median house value for California districts based on various features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the California Housing dataset, which includes the following features:

MedInc: Median income in block group

HouseAge: Median house age in block group

AveRooms: Average number of rooms per household

AveBedrms: Average number of bedrooms per household

Population: Block group population

AveOccup: Average number of household members

Latitude: Block group latitude

Longitude: Block group longitude

Steps
Data Loading: Load the California Housing dataset using fetch_california_housing from sklearn.datasets.

Data Preprocessing: Standardize the dataset to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training: Train a Linear Regression model using the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using cross-validation and calculate the mean squared error.

Prediction: Predict the median house values for the test data and visualize the results.

Visualization: Use Seaborn to create a distribution plot of the prediction errors.

Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression-practical-implementation.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd linear-regression-practical-implementation
Install the required packages:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the implementation:

bash
jupyter notebook Linear_Regression_Practical_Implementation.ipynb
Results
The model achieves a mean squared error of approximately -0.5257 and an R-squared score of 0.3451 on the test data. The distribution plot of the prediction errors shows a fairly normal distribution, indicating a good fit.
